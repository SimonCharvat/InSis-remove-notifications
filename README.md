# InSis: Remove Notifications  

**InSis Remove Notifications** is a Python script designed to simplify the process of clearing notifications on the **inSIS student platform** for **VÅ E University**. The script automates the task of closing all notifications, which would otherwise need to be done manually one by one.  

## Features  
- Uses **Selenium** to simulate user interactions on the inSIS platform.  
- Automatically logs in and clears all notifications.  
- Saves time and effort for students overwhelmed by multiple notifications.  

## Requirements  

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8 or newer  
- The following Python packages:  
  ```plaintext
  time  
  selenium  
  webdriver_manager  
  pwinput  
  ```
- You can install packages via pip:
  ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager pwinput
   ```  


## Usage  

1. Run the script using Python:  
   ```bash
   python InSis.py
   ```  

2. You will be prompted to enter your inSIS credentials securely including 2FA code.  

3. The script will log into your account, locate all notifications, and close them.  

## Security  

- The script uses the **pwinput** package to securely hide your password during input.
- The script does not store the credentials in any way.
- The script is open-source so you can make sure that there is no malicious intent.
